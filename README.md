# Project-Code

This Repo is meant to be for all the assignments and projects that are done by me and my friends while following a timetable similar to the one suggested by Siraj in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OvRVlqKebI) and this [repo](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Computer_Science_in_5_Months).

Week wise sources we followed are mentioned below.
Our Mini-Projects and Assignments can be found in the individual week folders.
